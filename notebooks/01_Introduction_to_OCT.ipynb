        "\n",
        "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to capture high-resolution, cross-sectional images of biological tissues. Think of it as \"ultrasound with light\" - but with much better resolution!\n",

        "### Key Features:\n",
        "- **Resolution**: 1-15 micrometers (much better than ultrasound)\n",
        "- **Penetration depth**: 1-2 mm in biological tissue\n",
        "- **Non-invasive**: Uses safe near-infrared light\n",
        "- **Real-time**: Can capture images in real-time\n",
