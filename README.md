# OCT-Principle: Teaching Materials for Optical Coherence Tomography

Welcome to the OCT-Principle repository! This repository contains educational materials for learning the basic principles of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

## üìö About This Repository

This repository provides interactive Google Colab notebooks that teach the fundamental concepts of OCT through code examples, simulations, and visualizations. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and can be run directly in Google Colab.
